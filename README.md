# To-Do:
1. Analyze a set of bank data using a python script using loops to find (total number of months included in the dataset, net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
2. Analyze a set of election data using a python script using loops to find (total number of votes cast, complete list of candidates who received votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, total number of votes each candidate won and winner of the election based on popular vote.)
